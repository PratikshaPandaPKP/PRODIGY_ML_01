The machine learning task provided by ProdigyInfoTech involves implementing a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The process includes importing necessary libraries, reading the dataset, and performing data cleaning and preparation steps such as handling missing values and selecting relevant features.

Exploratory data analysis is conducted through visualizations like scatter plots and heatmaps to understand the relationships between variables. The model is then trained using the training dataset and evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared value. Additionally, cross-validation is employed to assess the model's performance.

Finally, the trained model is utilized to predict the price of a new house, and a scatter plot is generated to compare actual prices with predicted prices. This comprehensive approach offers valuable insights into housing price prediction using linear regression.
